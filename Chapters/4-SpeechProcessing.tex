\label{SpeechProcessing}

The speech-processing component mainly comprises a microservice wrapping OpenAIs Whisper project and the management 
that utilizes this component to process audio streams. It receives slices of the audio stream, various in length, and
transcribes them into text.

Since Whisper cannot process audio streams directly but solely complete audio files, this service is required to build 
the basis to transcribe slices of the audio stream.
