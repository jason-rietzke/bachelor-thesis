\chapter{Session Handling and Message Translation}

\label{SessionHandlingAndMessageTranslation}

The session handling and message translation components are responsible for managing the interaction between the 
different session participants and translating the messages between the different languages if necessary.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Session Handling}

A session represents a single conversation between multiple participants. It contains all the information about the 
users, their audio connections, and the messages sent in this session. The session handling component is 
responsible for creating and managing these interactions.

After a session is created, it is assigned a unique session ID. This session ID is used to identify the session and 
allows the participants to join the session. After a user joins, the session registers the user and keeps track of 
their session-related data, like their determined language.

\subsection{Message Handling}

After a user object identifies the start of a new message, it creates a new message object and assigns it to the 
session. The session receives all updates regarding the message and notifies all subscribed participants about the 
changes. Users connected to a session via Web Browser can see the updates to the messages in real time since the 
session sends the updates via WebSockets.

After a message is complete and its processing is finished, the session determines the language of the message and 
finds all foreign languages present in the session by different users. It then requests all necessary translations.

\subsection{Interface Options}

A session provides multiple options to interact with it. One of them is the WebSocket interface, which allows 
subscribing and unsubscribing to events like creating and updating messages or updating the entire session object, 
for instance, when a new user joins the session. The web browser client uses this interface to receive updates about 
the session and its messages to display them to the user.

Another option is a WebHook interface. This allows third-party applications to subscribe to the session and receive 
updates about it and its messages. If a service registers to a WebHook, a session sends all updates to the HTTP 
endpoint of the service. This interface can be used by any third-party application to integrate with the System and 
receive updates about the session.

\section{Message Translation}

The message translation component is responsible for translating messages in different languages. It uses DeepL to 
translate the message content and returns the translated message to the session handling component.

It gets triggered by the session after a message is complete and its audio processing is finished. The session 
determines the language of the message and finds all foreign languages present in the session by different users. 
It then requests all necessary translations. 

After providing the translated message for each requested language, the session notifies all subscribed parties about 
the newly available translation. The web browser client uses this to display the translated message to the user. 
Third-party applications can use the WebHook interface to receive and integrate the translated message into their 
application.

The translation is also used to synthesize the translated message in a foreign language. The session handling component 
uses the synthesized audio file to play it back to the users in a foreign language. Especially in the case of a Voice 
over IP connection, this is the only way to provide the translated message to the participant and allows them to 
communicate with each other.\\

The translation service is the only component of the speech-processing pipeline that does not run on-premise. It is an 
external service DeepL provides and can not be hosted on demand. It is, however, possible to host a similar translation 
service on-premise and use it instead of DeepL. The speech-processing pipeline is designed to be versatile and allows 
the integration of any translation service. However, this is outside the scope of this work and will not be further 
discussed.
