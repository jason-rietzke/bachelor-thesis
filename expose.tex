\section{Description}
The subject of this thesis is to develop an application that receives audio streams (e.g., from phone calls) to transcribe the spoken content and slice it into individual messages utilizing OpenAI Whisper as a foundation.
The resulting messages can be beneficial for various purposes, such as displaying a chat history, semantic analysis, or interacting with a bot.

The focus of this work lies in the use case of communication between participants speaking different languages. 
The system can translate a message into the languages of the other parties and synthesize the translation to spoken text to feed it back into the audio stream to enable near real-time communication.


\section{Relevance}
The ability to communicate with people from different countries and cultures is becoming increasingly important in today's globalized world.
Especially in time-critical applications like emergency services, it is vital to communicate with people in their native language to provide the best possible assistance in critical situations.


\section{Research Question}
How can audio streams be processed in near real-time using OpenAI Whisper for high-quality transcription with optional translation and speech synthesis to overcome language barriers in real-time communication?


\section{Approach}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Receiving audio: Build endpoints to receive audio streams from voice-over-IP providers.
  \item Voice activation: Recognize spoken content to begin and end separate messages from a continuous audio stream.
  \item Language detection: Detect the spoken language.
  \item Transcription: Using OpenAI Whisper to transcribe the audio data into text.
  \item Session handling: Organize related users, their respective audio streams, and transcribed messages into sessions.
  \item Translation: Check for multiple spoken languages within one session and translate the transcription if necessary.
  \item Speech synthesis: Synthesize an audio file from the transcription and feed it back into the audio stream.
\end{enumerate}
