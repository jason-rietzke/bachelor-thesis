\begin{abstract}

The primary objective of this bachelor's thesis is to develop a testable prototype for a speech-processing pipeline 
that receives audio streams from various sources and transcribes and translates them in near real-time. The prototype 
facilitates communication between emergency control centers and callers speaking different languages. The focus is on 
utilizing open-source technologies like OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition. The System's functionality revolves 
around processing audio streams, segmenting them into individual messages, and managing them within a session context 
specific to foreign language communication. The prototype is integrated into the Notitia application, leveraging 
existing internal modules for user authentication and data-stream integration to the Voice over IP provider.

The thesis explores the integration of various open-source technologies. It aims to optimize the processing time of the 
speech-processing pipeline to meet the stringent time constraints that characterize emergencies. The average processing 
time of the pipeline is measured for different numbers of simultaneous audio streams to evaluate the performance and 
conclude a sufficient transcription interval.

This work shows that the speech-processing pipeline meets most requirements and is sufficiently fast to handle multiple 
audio streams simultaneously. It also shows that the pipeline can be built using primarily open-source software and 
commodity hardware. The text translation is the only component not based on an open-source project.

This thesis concludes that the speech-processing pipeline is a viable solution for emergency call centers to overcome 
language barriers in real-time communication. It can provide near real-time transcription and translation of spoken 
content and can be deployed on-premise to ensure reliability in emergencies.
